## Description

This is a prework study guide that is for students who need a quick reference or overview of what was covered during the beginning stages of the bootcamp.
Motivated to learn in a quick pace, this was a sure way to have the notes compiled in one place for convenience.
I was able to learn the very basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that will help apply to the actual bootcamp.

This is used for students who want to refer the easy to follow steps when learning about coding. They can refer to the DevTools so that they can see the recommended order on what to go over, and then follow up with however they see fit to take any notes down that would help them.
